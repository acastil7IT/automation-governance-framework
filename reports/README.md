# Test Reports Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains test execution reports and artifacts generated by the enterprise test automation governance framework. Reports provide comprehensive visibility into test results, coverage metrics, and quality assessments.

## Report Categories

### Playwright Test Reports
- **Location**: `playwright-report/`
- **Format**: Interactive HTML with detailed test results
- **Content**: Test execution status, screenshots, traces, and performance metrics
- **Access**: Open `index.html` in web browser

### Cucumber BDD Reports
- **Location**: `cucumber-report.html`
- **Format**: HTML report with scenario details
- **Content**: Feature execution results, step definitions, and scenario outcomes
- **Integration**: Links to corresponding test artifacts

### JSON Data Reports
- **Location**: `test-results.json`
- **Format**: Machine-readable JSON
- **Content**: Structured test data for integration with external systems
- **Usage**: Dashboard integration, metrics collection, trend analysis

## Report Generation

### Automated Generation
Reports are automatically generated during:
- Pull request validation workflows
- Release pipeline execution
- Manual test runs via GitHub Actions

### Local Generation
Generate reports locally using:
```bash
npm test                    # Generates Playwright reports
npm run test:cucumber      # Generates Cucumber reports
```

## Artifact Management

### GitHub Actions Integration
- Reports are uploaded as workflow artifacts
- Artifacts are retained according to repository settings
- Download links are available in workflow summaries

### Storage Locations
- **CI/CD Artifacts**: GitHub Actions artifact storage
- **Local Reports**: Generated in `reports/` directory
- **Archive Storage**: Long-term retention as configured

## Report Access

### Via GitHub Actions
1. Navigate to repository Actions tab
2. Select completed workflow run
3. Download artifacts from workflow summary
4. Extract and open HTML reports locally

### Direct File Access
Reports generated locally are immediately available in the `reports/` directory structure.

## Integration Capabilities

### Dashboard Integration
JSON reports support integration with:
- Quality dashboards and metrics platforms
- Continuous integration reporting tools
- Custom analytics and monitoring solutions

### API Access
Report data can be accessed programmatically through:
- GitHub Actions API for artifact retrieval
- Repository API for workflow status
- Custom integrations via JSON report parsing

## Data Retention

### Retention Policies
- **Pull Request Reports**: 30 days (configurable)
- **Release Reports**: 90 days (configurable)
- **Critical Reports**: Extended retention as required

### Compliance Requirements
Report retention aligns with organizational compliance and audit requirements for quality assurance documentation.

## Security Considerations

### Data Sanitization
- Reports exclude sensitive application data
- Authentication credentials are not included in artifacts
- Personal identifiable information is filtered from results

### Access Controls
- Report access follows repository permission model
- Sensitive reports may require additional authorization
- Audit logs track report access and downloads

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Reports
- Verify workflow execution completed successfully
- Check artifact upload steps in workflow logs
- Confirm report generation scripts executed without errors

### Report Access Issues
- Validate repository permissions for artifact access
- Check artifact retention settings and expiration dates
- Verify network connectivity for artifact downloads

### Integration Problems
- Confirm JSON report format compatibility
- Validate API endpoints and authentication
- Check integration service connectivity and permissions

## Support

For report-related issues or enhancement requests:
- Create repository issue with detailed description
- Include workflow logs and error messages
- Specify report type and expected behavior
- Tag quality engineering team for review
